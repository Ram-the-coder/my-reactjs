**What is this?**
A basic implementation of react.js with comments for easy understanding.
Find the implementation in src/MyReact.js

**Features Implemented:**
1. Basic JSX to HTML using `MyReact.createElement` and `MyReact.render` functions
2. Concurrent Mode
3. A basic version of fiber reconciliation
4. Support for function components
5. Support for useState hook

**Credits**
I used https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/ this guide to build it

**Notes**
Its bootstraped using create-react-app. But that is only because I didn't want to setup babel, webpack and stuff from scratch on my own.
